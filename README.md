# BootFox32
BootFox32 is an extension upon the
[RedFox32](https://github.com/RedFox0x20/RedFox32) project with the aim to
develop and build each component individually so that the ideas can be applied
to multiple projects rather than being fixed into one large code base.

In doing this I will have the following repositories for low level software
design and development:
* [RedFox32](https://github.com/RedFox0x20/RedFox32) - My resulting operating
system produced by combining each individual element.
* [BootFox32](https://github.com/RedFox0x20/BootFox32) - This repository! The
bootloader that kick starts any other OS projects.
* [FileFox32](https://github.com/RedFox0x20/FileFox32) - A future project for the design and development of a FileSystem which can be
used

As always, these are for my own research and development! They are not intended
for use in the wild, they are just learning resources for myself and people like
you!
